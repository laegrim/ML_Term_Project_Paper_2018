\section{Background}
\subsection{Recommendation Systems}
Recommendation systems predict the preferences of users in regard to new items or objects, in the form of a ranking of items or objects, rating items or objects, or classifying items or objects \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/ZhangYS17aa}. There exist a wide variety of established strategies to learn prediction models for recommendation systems, generally fitting into three categories: collaborative filtering, content based, or hybrid systems. Collaborative filtering based recommendation system models learn based on user - item/object interaction, while content based recommendation system models learn based on intrinsic user and item/object characteristics. Hybrid recommendation system models learn based on a combination of the two approaches.  
\subsection{Deep Learning}
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning wherein models learned contain multiple, often heiarchical, abstractions or representations. While there are many approaches to deep learning, in this paper we employ deep feedforward neural networks - feed forward neural networks with one or more hidden layers. A general interpretation of the hidden layers in a deep feedforward neural network is that each layer learns a slightly more complex representation of the data than the layer before it.
\subsection{Embedding Layers}
Embedding layers encode information about a set of objects and the relationships between those objects in a latent space - generally with fewer dimensions than the original space representing the objects \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781}. For example, given a corpus of text with a large vocabulary \textit{V}, it may be desireable to represent $\textit{v}\in\textit{V}$ such that $\mid\textit{rep(v)}\mid=\textit{k}$, where $\textit{k}\ll\mid\textit{V}\mid$ and that if \textit{v}, $\textit{x}\in\textit{V}$ occur together more frequently than \textit{v}, $\textit{y}\in\textit{V}$, \textit{v} will be closer to \textit{x} than \textit{y}.
