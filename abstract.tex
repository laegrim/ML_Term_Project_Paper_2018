Recommendation systems play an increasingly vital role in the ability to make informed decisions
in modern societies, given the ever growing deluge of data which might inform those decisions. Without
the ability to quickly choose from among a few well selected options ordinary activities from applying to
jobs to searching the internet, buying household goods, or reading the latest news might become difficult,
deceptive, or even dangerous. Given the relatively many recent major advances in machine learning
techniques, especially in relation to deep learning, it is important to understand how recommendation
systems have changed and improved.
